print("""
Your prototype expects DAILY/WEEKLY data with city-level locations.
Your dataset has YEARLY data with country-level locations.

Three options:

1. üîÑ UPDATE PROTOTYPE to match your data reality:
   - Change "7-Day Trends" ‚Üí "Yearly Trends"  
   - Change "vs last week" ‚Üí "vs last year"
   - Keep country-level (not city) locations
   - ‚úÖ Can launch IMMEDIATELY with current data

2. üåç ENHANCE API with missing data:
   - Add 233 country coordinates (quick fix)
   - Simulate daily breakdowns from yearly data
   - Use NLP to extract city locations
   - ‚è±Ô∏è Takes 2-3 hours

3. üìä COLLECT REAL-TIME DATA:
   - Use RSS/news ingestion (already built!)
   - Get actual daily case counts
   - Extract real city locations
   - ‚è±Ô∏è Takes 1-2 days for full implementation

I recommend Option 1 or 2 for fastest results!
